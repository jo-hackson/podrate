# Podrate
An app that rates the toxicity level of the audio file that you input. The goal is to be able to rate podcasts and have a understanding of the content prior to listening.

Input an audio file (limit of 80MB). 

An example one that you can use is https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~i101/SoundFiles/preamble10.wav.
Once the transcription is complete, then you will be taken to a page to see the results based on various levels.
